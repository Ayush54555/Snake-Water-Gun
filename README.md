# 🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game

A simple command-line version of the classic **Snake-Water-Gun** game built with Python. It's a fun twist on Rock-Paper-Scissors, where:

- 🐍 Snake drinks water
- 💧 Water douses gun
- 🔫 Gun kills snake

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- You'll be prompted to enter a choice:
  - `s` for Snake
  - `w` for Water
  - `g` for Gun
- The computer randomly selects its move.
- The winner is determined based on the following rules:
  - **Snake** beats Water
  - **Water** beats Gun
  - **Gun** beats Snake
  - Same choice results in a draw

## 🛠️ Requirements

No external libraries are required except Python's built-in `random` module.
